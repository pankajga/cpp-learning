# Selection Sort

*Steps: (sorting in increasing order)*

1. First-of-all, we will find the smallest element of the array and swap that with the element at index 0.

2. Similarly, we will find the second smallest and swap that with the element at index 1 and so on...

3. Ultimately, we will be getting a sorted array in increasing order only.
