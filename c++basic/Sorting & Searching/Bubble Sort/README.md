# Bubble Sort

In selection sort the elements from the start get placed at the correct position first and then the further elements, but in the bubble sort, the elements start to place correctly from the end.

In this technique, we just compare the two adjacent elements of the array and then sort them manually by swapping if not sorted. Similarly, we will compare the next two elements (one from the previous position and the corresponding next) of the array and sort them manually. This way the elements from the last get placed in their correct position. This is the difference between selection sort and bubble sort.

*In Selection Sort we are fixing a index and finding the minimum value from the rest of the array and finally swapping the minimum with the index.*

*In Bubble sort we are traversing by comparing neighbouring values and if greater swap it and continue to iterate, hence after the first iteration we will get the max value at the final index of the array.*
